This is a project I made for my Senior Thesis at Nova Classical Academy.
My goal was to utalize machine learning and AI models to accurately read and predict one of the seven basic emotoyions (happieness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, disgust).
The code uses the SVM machine learning model to use a set of training images to create a new custom model each time the program is ran. 
While the program is not 100% accurate, for the small size of the training data, its accuracy of about 50% is acceptable. 

I ended uip passing my thesis presentation :)
